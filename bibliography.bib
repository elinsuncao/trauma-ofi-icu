               a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Global development goals increasingly rely on
               country-specific estimates for benchmarking a nation's progress.
               To meet this need, the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and
               Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2016 estimated global, regional,
               national, and, for selected locations, subnational
               cause-specific mortality beginning in the year 1980. Here we
               report an update to that study, making use of newly available
               data and improved methods. GBD 2017 provides a comprehensive
               assessment of cause-specific mortality for 282 causes in 195
               countries and territories from 1980 to 2017. METHODS: The causes
               of death database is composed of vital registration (VR), verbal
               autopsy (VA), registry, survey, police, and surveillance data.
               GBD 2017 added ten VA studies, 127 country-years of VR data, 502
               cancer-registry country-years, and an additional surveillance
               country-year. Expansions of the GBD cause of death hierarchy
               resulted in 18 additional causes estimated for GBD 2017. Newly
               available data led to subnational estimates for five additional
               countries-Ethiopia, Iran, New Zealand, Norway, and Russia.
               Deaths assigned International Classification of Diseases (ICD)
               codes for non-specific, implausible, or intermediate causes of
               death were reassigned to underlying causes by redistribution
               algorithms that were incorporated into uncertainty estimation.
               We used statistical modelling tools developed for GBD, including
               the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm), to generate cause
               fractions and cause-specific death rates for each location,
               year, age, and sex. Instead of using UN estimates as in previous
               versions, GBD 2017 independently estimated population size and
               fertility rate for all locations. Years of life lost (YLLs) were
               then calculated as the sum of each death multiplied by the
               standard life expectancy at each age. All rates reported here
               are age-standardised. FINDINGS: At the broadest grouping of
               causes of death (Level 1), non-communicable diseases (NCDs)
               comprised the greatest fraction of deaths, contributing to
               73·4\% (95\% uncertainty interval [UI] 72·5-74·1) of total
               deaths in 2017, while communicable, maternal, neonatal, and
               nutritional (CMNN) causes accounted for 18·6\% (17·9-19·6), and
               injuries 8·0\% (7·7-8·2). Total numbers of deaths from NCD
               causes increased from 2007 to 2017 by 22·7\% (21·5-23·9),
               representing an additional 7·61 million (7·20-8·01) deaths
               estimated in 2017 versus 2007. The death rate from NCDs
               decreased globally by 7·9\% (7·0-8·8). The number of deaths for
               CMNN causes decreased by 22·2\% (20·0-24·0) and the death rate
               by 31·8\% (30·1-33·3). Total deaths from injuries increased by
               2·3\% (0·5-4·0) between 2007 and 2017, and the death rate from
               injuries decreased by 13·7\% (12·2-15·1) to 57·9 deaths
               (55·9-59·2) per 100 000 in 2017. Deaths from substance use
               disorders also increased, rising from 284 000 deaths (268
               000-289 000) globally in 2007 to 352 000 (334 000-363 000) in
               2017. Between 2007 and 2017, total deaths from conflict and
               terrorism increased by 118·0\% (88·8-148·6). A greater reduction
               in total deaths and death rates was observed for some CMNN
               causes among children younger than 5 years than for older
               adults, such as a 36·4\% (32·2-40·6) reduction in deaths from
               lower respiratory infections for children younger than 5 years
               compared with a 33·6\% (31·2-36·1) increase in adults older than
               70 years. Globally, the number of deaths was greater for men
               than for women at most ages in 2017, except at ages older than
               85 years. Trends in global YLLs reflect an epidemiological
               transition, with decreases in total YLLs from enteric
               infections, respiratory infections and tuberculosis, and
               maternal and neonatal disorders between 1990 and 2017; these
               were generally greater in magnitude at the lowest levels of the
               Socio-demographic Index (SDI). At the same time, there were
               large increases in YLLs from neoplasms and cardiovascular
               diseases. YLL rates decreased across the five leading Level 2
               causes in all SDI quintiles. The leading causes of YLLs in
               1990-neonatal disorders, lower respiratory infections, and
               diarrhoeal diseases-were ranked second, fourth, and fifth, in
               2017. Meanwhile, estimated YLLs increased for ischaemic heart
               disease (ranked first in 2017) and stroke (ranked third), even
               though YLL rates decreased. Population growth contributed to
               increased total deaths across the 20 leading Level 2 causes of
               mortality between 2007 and 2017. Decreases in the cause-specific
               mortality rate reduced the effect of population growth for all
               but three causes: substance use disorders, neurological
               disorders, and skin and subcutaneous diseases. INTERPRETATION:
               Improvements in global health have been unevenly distributed
               among populations. Deaths due to injuries, substance use
               disorders, armed conflict and terrorism, neoplasms, and
               cardiovascular disease are expanding threats to global health.
               For causes of death such as lower respiratory and enteric
               infections, more rapid progress occurred for children than for
               the oldest adults, and there is continuing disparity in
               mortality rates by sex across age groups. Reductions in the
               death rate of some common diseases are themselves slowing or
               have ceased, primarily for NCDs, and the death rate for selected
               causes has increased in the past decade. FUNDING: Bill \&

               post-discharge socioeconomic and quality-of-life outcomes can
               help better understand and reduce the consequences of trauma.
               METHODS: We performed a scoping review to map the existing
               research on post-discharge outcomes for trauma patients,
               irrespective of the country or setting in which the study was
               performed. The scoping review was conducted by searching six
               databases - MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, Global Index
               Medicus, BASE, and Web of Science - to identify all articles
               that report post-discharge socioeconomic or quality of life
               outcomes in trauma patients from 2009 to 2018. RESULTS: Seven
               hundred fifty-eight articles were included in this study,
               extracting 958 outcomes. Most studies (82\%) were from
               high-income countries (HICs). More studies from low- and
               middle-income countries (LMICs) were cross-sectional (71\%)
               compared with HIC settings (46\%). There was a wide variety of
               different definitions, interpretations, and measurements used by
               various articles for similar outcomes. Quality of life, return
               to work, social support, cost, and participation were the main
               outcomes studied in post-discharge trauma patients. CONCLUSIONS:
               The wide range of outcomes and outcome measures reported across
               different types of injuries and settings. This variability can
               be a barrier when comparing across different types of injuries
               and settings. Post-discharge trauma studies should move towards
               building evidence based on standardized measurement of outcomes.",

               Risk Factors study used the disability-adjusted life year (DALY)
               to quantify the burden of diseases, injuries, and risk factors.
               This paper provides an overview of injury estimates from the
               2013 update of GBD, with detailed information on incidence,
               mortality, DALYs and rates of change from 1990 to 2013 for 26
               causes of injury, globally, by region and by country. METHODS:
               Injury mortality was estimated using the extensive GBD mortality
               database, corrections for ill-defined cause of death and the
               cause of death ensemble modelling tool. Morbidity estimation was
               based on inpatient and outpatient data sets, 26 cause-of-injury
               and 47 nature-of-injury categories, and seven follow-up studies
               with patient-reported long-term outcome measures. RESULTS: In
               2013, 973 million (uncertainty interval (UI) 942 to 993) people
               sustained injuries that warranted some type of healthcare and
               4.8 million (UI 4.5 to 5.1) people died from injuries. Between
               1990 and 2013 the global age-standardised injury DALY rate
               decreased by 31\% (UI 26\% to 35\%). The rate of decline in DALY
               rates was significant for 22 cause-of-injury categories,
               including all the major injuries. CONCLUSIONS: Injuries continue
               to be an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the
               developed and developing world. The decline in rates for almost
               all injuries is so prominent that it warrants a general
               statement that the world is becoming a safer place to live in.
               However, the patterns vary widely by cause, age, sex, region and
               time and there are still large improvements that need to be
               made.",

              trauma deaths contains many unstudied confounding factors. To
              investigate the reliability of methods for identifying such
              preventable deaths, we compared three consensus systems using
              separate five-member general review panels assessing 20
              non-central nervous system fatalities: panel A, independent
              judgments; panel B, discussion of all cases preceding individual
              judgments; and panel C, independent judgments followed by
              discussion and equivocal case reassignment. The Kappa concordance
              index was low for all methods (method A, 0.20; methods B and C,
              0.40). Of the 11 deaths judged preventable by at least one panel,
              only one death was judged preventable by all three panels.
              Consensus agreement (four of five assessors) was 20\% for panel
              A, 45\% for panel B, and 10\% for panel C (difference between
              panels B and C, p less than 0.03). In panel C, discussion
              affected the rate of equivocal case designation from 30\% to 5\%.
              Thus different consensus methods yielded different results. We
              conclude that individual case review can be severely flawed and
              therefore should not be used to measure institutional quality of
              patient care. We recommend that assessment of institutional
              performance should be based on objective evaluation methods,
              which require the study of patient population outcomes, rather

              from the Karolinska University Hospital who had been reviewed
              regarding the presence of OFI as defined by a morbidity and
              mortality conference. We used bi- and multivariable logistic
              regression to assess the associations between the following
              patient and process factors and OFI: age, sex, respiratory rate,
              systolic blood pressure, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), Injury
              Severity Score (ISS), survival at 30 days, highest hospital care
              level, arrival on working hours, arrival on weekends, intubation
              status and time to first computed tomography (CT). RESULTS: OFI
              was identified in 300 (5.8\%) out of 5182 patients. Age, missing
              Glasgow Coma Scale, time to first CT, highest hospital care level
              and ISS were statistically significantly associated with OFI.
              CONCLUSION: Several patient and process factors were found to be
              associated with OFI, indicating that patients with moderate to
              severe trauma and those with delays to first CT are at the
              highest odds of OFI.",

  abstract = "Trauma is a significant public health issue worldwide,
              particularly affecting economically active age groups. Quality
              management of trauma care at the national level is crucial to
              improve outcomes of major trauma. In Korea, a biennial nationwide
              survey on preventable trauma death rate is conducted. Based on
              the survey results, we analyzed opportunities for improving the
              trauma treatment process. Expert panels reviewed records of 8282
              and 8482 trauma-related deaths in 2017 and 2019, respectively,
              identifying 258 and 160 cases in each year as preventable deaths.
              Opportunities for improvement were categorized into prehospital,
              interhospital, and hospital stages. Hemorrhage was the primary
              cause of death, followed by sepsis/multiorgan failure and central
              nervous system injury. Delayed hemostatic procedures and
              transfusions were common areas for improvement in hospital stage.
              Interhospital transfers experienced significant delays in arrival
              time. This study emphasizes the need to enhance trauma care by
              refining treatment techniques, centralizing patients in
              specialized facilities, and implementing comprehensive reviews
              and performance improvements throughout the patient transfer
              system. The findings offer valuable insights for addressing
              trauma care improvement from both clinical and systemic
              perspectives.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Bleeding is the leading cause of preventable death
               after injury. This retrospective study aimed to characterize
               opportunities for performance improvement (OPIs) identified in
               patients who died from bleeding and were considered by the
               quality improvement system of a major trauma centre. METHODS:
               All trauma deaths in 2006-2010 were discussed at the trauma
               morbidity and mortality meeting. Deaths from haemorrhage were
               identified and subjected to qualitative and quantitative
               evaluation. OPIs were identified and remedial action was taken.
               RESULTS: During the study interval there were 7511 trauma team
               activations; 423 patients died. Haemorrhage was the second most
               common cause of death, in 112 patients, and made a substantial
               contribution to death in a further 15. For 84 of these 127
               patients, a total of 150 OPIs were identified. Most arose in the
               emergency department, but involved personnel from many
               departments. Problems with decision-making were more common than
               errors in technical skill. OPIs frequently involved the decision
               between surgery, radiology and further investigation. Delayed
               and inappropriate surgery occurred even when investigation and
               diagnosis were appropriate. The mortality rate among patients
               presenting in shock fell significantly over the study interval
               (P < 0·026). CONCLUSION: Problems with judgement are more common
               than those of skill. Death from traumatic haemorrhage is
               associated with identifiable, remediable failures in care. The
               implementation of a systematic trauma quality improvement system
               was associated with a fall in the mortality rate among patients
               presenting in shock.",

               triggering bedside recording and to report the types of
               performance issues identified that were then used to inform
               dedicated ICU quality improvement efforts. DESIGN: This is a
               retrospective descriptive analysis of a video review program
               conducted at a single institution from July 2016 to November
               2019. SETTING: Surgical and Trauma ICU at a single urban
               academic quaternary care center. PATIENTS: All patients admitted
               to the surgical and trauma ICU between July 2016 and November
               2019 were eligible for the study as all ICU beds in our health
               system institutions are equipped with closed circuit video/audio
               monitoring. Through an institutional review board approved
               program, any event triggering the immediate bedside presence of
               a provider in the ICU is routinely recorded at the discretion of
               the care team or tele-intensivist. INTERVENTIONS: A database of
               these events was created over a 3-year period, and cases were
               reviewed for content, quality improvement, and educational
               opportunities. Select recordings were analyzed and shared at
               multidisciplinary/multiprofessional video review sessions.
               MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: There were 286 critical events
               video recorded and reviewed in the ICUs between July 2016 and
               November 2019. The most commonly recorded events included:
               cardiopulmonary arrests (n = 75), intubations (n = 71), and
               acute clinical decompensation triggered by nonreassuring vital
               signs (n = 57) or arrhythmias (n = 13). Of these recordings, 59
               were shared at video review conferences, where quality of care
               was assessed and thematic opportunities for improvement were
               characterized. Recurrent quality improvement themes that were
               identified included adherence to protocols, the importance of
               teamwork and closed-loop communication, clearly designated team
               leadership, and the use of universal precautions. CONCLUSIONS:
               Video review in the ICU is feasible and presents valuable
               opportunities for quality improvement and educational
               discussions.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Preventable deaths due to errors in trauma patients
               with otherwise survivable injuries account for up to 10\% of
               fatalities in Level I trauma centers, 50\% of these errors occur
               in the intensive care unit (ICU). The root cause of 67\% of the
               Joint Commission sentinel events is communication errors. The
               objective is (1) to study how critical information degrades and
               how it is lost over 24 hours and (2) to determine whether a
               structured checklist for ICU handoffs prevents information loss.
               METHODS: Prospective cohort study of trauma and surgical ICU
               teams observed with and without use of the checklist. An
               observational period (control group) was followed by a didactic
               session on the science and use of a checklist (study group),
               which was used for patient management and handoffs. Information
               was tracked for a 24-hour period and all handoffs. Comparisons
               use chi or Fisher's exact test and a p value <0.05 was defined
               as significant. RESULTS: Three hundred and thirty-two patient
               ICU days were observed (119 control, 213 study) and 689 patient
               care items (303 control, 386 study) were followed. Seventy-five
               (10.9\%) items were lost over 24 hours; 61 of 303 (20.1\%)
               without checklist and 14 of 386 (3.6\%) with checklist (p <
               0.0001). Critical laboratory values and test results were the
               most frequent lost items (36.1\% control vs. 4.5\% study p <
               0.0001). Six of 75 (8.1\%) items were correctly ordered but not
               carried out by ICU nursing staff--all caught and corrected with
               checklist use. CONCLUSION: Critical information is degraded over
               24 hours in the ICU. A structured checklist significantly
               reduces patient errors due to lost information and communication
               lapses between trauma ICU team members at handoffs of care.",
