  abstract = "The published evaluation of methods for identifying preventable
              trauma deaths contains many unstudied confounding factors. To
              investigate the reliability of methods for identifying such
              preventable deaths, we compared three consensus systems using
              separate five-member general review panels assessing 20
              non-central nervous system fatalities: panel A, independent
              judgments; panel B, discussion of all cases preceding individual
              judgments; and panel C, independent judgments followed by
              discussion and equivocal case reassignment. The Kappa concordance
              index was low for all methods (method A, 0.20; methods B and C,
              0.40). Of the 11 deaths judged preventable by at least one panel,
              only one death was judged preventable by all three panels.
              Consensus agreement (four of five assessors) was 20\% for panel
              A, 45\% for panel B, and 10\% for panel C (difference between
              panels B and C, p less than 0.03). In panel C, discussion
              affected the rate of equivocal case designation from 30\% to 5\%.
              Thus different consensus methods yielded different results. We
              conclude that individual case review can be severely flawed and
              therefore should not be used to measure institutional quality of
              patient care. We recommend that assessment of institutional
              performance should be based on objective evaluation methods,
              which require the study of patient population outcomes, rather
              than on subjective methods in which individual cases are
              reviewed.",

              mortality worldwide. Morbidity and mortality review of selected
              patient cases is used to improve the quality of trauma care by
              identifying opportunities for improvement (OFI). The aim of this
              study was to assess how patient and process factors are
              associated with OFI in trauma care. METHODS: We conducted a
              registry-based study using all patients between 2017 and 2021
              from the Karolinska University Hospital who had been reviewed
              regarding the presence of OFI as defined by a morbidity and
              mortality conference. We used bi- and multivariable logistic
              regression to assess the associations between the following
              patient and process factors and OFI: age, sex, respiratory rate,
              systolic blood pressure, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), Injury
              Severity Score (ISS), survival at 30 days, highest hospital care
              level, arrival on working hours, arrival on weekends, intubation
              status and time to first computed tomography (CT). RESULTS: OFI
              was identified in 300 (5.8\%) out of 5182 patients. Age, missing
              Glasgow Coma Scale, time to first CT, highest hospital care level
              and ISS were statistically significantly associated with OFI.
              CONCLUSION: Several patient and process factors were found to be
              associated with OFI, indicating that patients with moderate to
              severe trauma and those with delays to first CT are at the
              highest odds of OFI.",

  abstract = "Trauma is a significant public health issue worldwide,
              particularly affecting economically active age groups. Quality
              management of trauma care at the national level is crucial to
              improve outcomes of major trauma. In Korea, a biennial nationwide
              survey on preventable trauma death rate is conducted. Based on
              the survey results, we analyzed opportunities for improving the
              trauma treatment process. Expert panels reviewed records of 8282
              and 8482 trauma-related deaths in 2017 and 2019, respectively,
              identifying 258 and 160 cases in each year as preventable deaths.
              Opportunities for improvement were categorized into prehospital,
              interhospital, and hospital stages. Hemorrhage was the primary
              cause of death, followed by sepsis/multiorgan failure and central
              nervous system injury. Delayed hemostatic procedures and
              transfusions were common areas for improvement in hospital stage.
              Interhospital transfers experienced significant delays in arrival
              time. This study emphasizes the need to enhance trauma care by
              refining treatment techniques, centralizing patients in
              specialized facilities, and implementing comprehensive reviews
              and performance improvements throughout the patient transfer
              system. The findings offer valuable insights for addressing
              trauma care improvement from both clinical and systemic
              perspectives.",
