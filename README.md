# Opportunities for Improvement in Adult Trauma Patients Admitted to the Intensive Care Unit

This repository includes the manuscript and code for the research project on _opportunities for improvement in adult trauma patients
admitted to the intensive care unit_.

## Summary

### Introduction

Trauma, the clinical entity composed of physical injury and the bodyâ€™s associated response, is aleading cause of mortality and morbidity
worldwide. A cornerstone of trauma qualityimprovement programs is multidisciplinary mortality and morbidity review to identifyopportunities
for improvement (OFI) and implement corrective actions. Examples ofopportunities for improvement may include lack of resources and
management errors. Manypatients with severe trauma is admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), but little is known aboutopportunities for
improvement in this group of patients.

### Aim

To characterise OFI in adult trauma patients admitted to the ICU and assess how patient factorsare associated with OFI in these patients.

### Methods

This is a registry based cohort study using data from the trauma registry and trauma care qualitydatabase at the Karolinska University
Hospital in Solna. The trauma registry includes about12000 patients treated between 2012 and 2022. The trauma care quality database is a
subset of thetrauma registry and includes about 6000 patients selected for review between 2014 and 2022. Theoutcome is OFI, as identified by
the multidisciplinary review board and recorded in the traumacare quality database. This project will link the two databases and assess what
types of OFIoccured in ICU patients and how different patient factors, such as age, sex, mechanism of injury,and injury severity, are
associated with OFI using logistic regression. A 5% significance level and95% confidence levels will be used.
